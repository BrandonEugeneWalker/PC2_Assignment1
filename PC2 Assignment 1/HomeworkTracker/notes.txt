Existing Issues:

1.) When saving and loading data it currently does not keep track of the class priority.
2.) When loading data sometimes extra blank rows are present under the loaded data.
3.) Output will not update till the text fields inside the data grid view lose focus, you said not to worry about this.
4.) Output will not update till the changed check box loses focus, you said not to worry about this.
